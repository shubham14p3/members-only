# members-only

In this project, we applied the knowledge acquired in the Authentication section of the curriculum. We used Devise gem to create an authentication environment for users and we used the scaffold method to create a complete MVC environment for the Posts. We used the previously acquired knowledge to manage the associations through Active Record, and finally, we displayed the logic to make the information about the posts appear or disappear for the user depending on whether he/she is authenticated or not.
